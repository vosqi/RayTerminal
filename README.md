Surprisingly there was a lack of CLI plugins on Roblox that utilized a more text/efficient workflow of commands instead of individually clicking on buttons.
I made this plugin as a teaser into what a workflow of using the CLI would feel like on Studio in relation to using the terminal on VsCode for other operations like Git, hosting, logging, etc.

The terminal utilizes the bash-like syntax commonly used on Unix systems (MacOS, Linux, etc).

This was an unfinished project in terms of the lack of commands, however each command provides a functionality that makes developing interesting in Roblox. It provides common commands found in bash such as cd, ls, echo, etc; aswell as some basic git commands that have the capability of fetching an entire repository and dynamically converting it to a Roblox-friendly format.
